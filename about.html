          I'm Trinity Sazo, a senior at Phillips Academy in Andover, MA. I'm currently taking a class in computer science on web design, which explains why this website has been created. The topic, however, was inspired by my love for the Pokémon games. I was introduced to the series about 10 years ago when I saw a guy playing Pokémon SoulSilver on his DS. Back then, I was more interested with the Poké device that came with the game. It tracked our steps and allowed us to encounter Pokémon out in the real world. Basically, I was brainwashed by the old school version of Pokémon GO. Nonetheless, I fell in love with the little creatures, the adventure, and the storylines (I convinced my mom that the games were forcing me to practice my reading with all the text).
        </p>
        <p>10 years later, I'm still hooked, as are many other players around the world. Given the wait for the new game, I love to look at fan art and the theories people make given possible easter eggs in previous games. Feel free to scroll through the photos and get pumped for the release of the new generation of Pokémon!</p>
